# Screenshot Notice

The actual screenshots will be available once the site is deployed to GitHub Pages.

For now, you can test the site locally by:
1. Opening `index.html` in a browser (static version)
2. Or running `python app.py` for the full Flask version

The site is fully functional and includes:
- Terminal-style interface with green theme
- Desktop search modal (Ctrl+K)
- Mobile search bar at bottom
- Responsive design for 16:9 and 20:9 aspect ratios
- Working search functionality with mock data
