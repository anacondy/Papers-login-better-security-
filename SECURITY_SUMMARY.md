## üöÄ Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Generate strong SECRET_KEY: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`
- [ ] Set all environment variables in `.env`
- [ ] Create admin user with strong password (12+ chars, mixed case, numbers, special chars)
- [ ] Set `FLASK_DEBUG=False`
- [ ] Set `FLASK_ENV=production`
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True`
- [ ] Configure firewall (allow only 22, 80, 443)
- [ ] Move database outside web root
- [ ] Set proper file permissions (600 for .env, .db)
- [ ] Set up regular backups
- [ ] Configure log rotation
- [ ] Test all functionality
- [ ] Review `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

## üîç What an Attacker Could Do (Before Fixes)

If someone found the original code, they could:

1. ‚ùå **Forge admin sessions** (hardcoded secret key)
2. ‚ùå **Login as admin** (hardcoded credentials)
3. ‚ùå **Access any file on server** (path traversal)
4. ‚ùå **Upload malicious files** (no validation)
5. ‚ùå **Execute code remotely** (debug mode + missing imports)
6. ‚ùå **Crash the application** (missing secure_filename)
7. ‚ùå **Steal database** (exposed in web root)
8. ‚ùå **Enumerate users** (verbose errors)

## ‚úÖ What an Attacker Can Do Now (After Fixes)

- Try to brute force login (limited by strong passwords)
- Upload PDFs only (properly validated)
- Access public pages only
- View generic error messages

**All critical attack vectors have been mitigated.**
