## Known Issues & Limitations

### Minor Issues Found:

1. **Dependency Conflict** ⚠️
   - The `safety==2.3.5` package has a version conflict with other packages
   - **Impact:** Security scanning tool not installed
   - **Workaround:** Can install separately with different version
   - **Does NOT prevent app from running**

2. **Network Timeout During Install** ⚠️
   - PyPI connection occasionally times out
   - **Impact:** Requires retries for installation
   - **Workaround:** Install packages without cache (`--no-cache-dir`)
   - **Does NOT affect running application**

3. **SECRET_KEY Warning** ⚠️
   - App warns if SECRET_KEY not set in environment
   - **Status:** Fixed by creating .env file
   - **Impact:** None after fix

### Expected Limitations (as per README):

- No authentication system implemented yet (Phase 2 pending)
- Paper upload functionality not fully implemented
- Search returns mock results (database integration pending)
- Production deployment needs additional configuration
